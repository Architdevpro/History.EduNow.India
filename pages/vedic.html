    <h2>Vedic Period (1500 BCE – 600 BCE)</h2>
    <p>
      The Vedic Period marks the foundation of Indian civilization, during which
      the <strong>Vedas</strong> – Rigveda, Samaveda, Yajurveda, and Atharvaveda –
      were composed. These texts form the bedrock of Indian spiritual, cultural,
      and social life.

      <h3>Society</h3>
      <p>
        The Vedic society was organized into <em>varnas</em> (social groups),
        with occupations and duties defined. Early society was more fluid but
        gradually became stratified. Women had a respected position in early Vedic
        times, participating in education and rituals.

      <h3>Politics</h3>
      <p>
        The polity was tribal, led by chiefs known as <em>rajas</em>. Assemblies
        such as the <em>Sabha</em> and <em>Samiti</em> played roles in decision-making.
        Over time, hereditary kingship and state formation began to emerge.

      <h3>Economy</h3>
      <p>
        The economy was largely pastoral in the early Vedic phase, later shifting
        towards agriculture in the Later Vedic period. Trade and the use of
        <em>nishka</em> (gold ornaments) as currency were known.

      <h3>Religion & Culture</h3>
      <p>
        The Vedic religion centered around fire sacrifices (<em>yajnas</em>)
        dedicated to deities such as Indra, Agni, and Varuna. Hymns and chants
        formed an essential part of worship. Music, poetry, and oral traditions
        flourished.

      <h3>Legacy</h3>
      <p>
        The philosophical ideas and rituals of this era laid the groundwork for
        Hinduism, while also influencing later schools of thought such as Buddhism
        and Jainism.
